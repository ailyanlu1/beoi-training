# Unit 18: All pairs Shortest path
This unit covers the all pairs shortest path Floyd-Warshall algorithm, along with the following applications:

- Transitive closure
- Graph minimax / maximin
- Graph safest path / most dangerous path
- Detecting negative weight cycles

Complementary notes can be found in section 4.5 of the book Competitive Programming 3.

## Prerequisites

- Unit 1: [Complexity](../01-complexity)
- Unit 6: [Graph representation](../06-graph-basics)
- Unit 14: [Graph traversal](../14-traversal) (mainly BFS)
- Unit 17: [Single source Shortest path](../17-single-source-shortest-path)


## Practice problems

### Easy

- UVa 567 - [Route Finding](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/5/567.pdf) (begin with that one)
- UVa 869 - [Airline Comparison](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/8/869.pdf)

### Medium

- UVa 1247 - [Interstar Transport](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/12/1247.pdf) (you need to print the path)
- Codeforces 295B - [Greg and Graph](http://codeforces.com/contest/295/problem/B)

### Harder

- UVa 104 - [Arbitrage](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/1/104.pdf) (interesting variant)
- UVa 12179 - [Randomly-priced Tickets](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/121/12179.pdf) (not a pure Floyd problem)
